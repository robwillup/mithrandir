# Preface

Design Patterns describe **simple** and **elegant** solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design. These solutions have been developed and evolved over time. 
Design Patterns capture these solutions in a succinct and easily applied form.

>"Once you understand the design patterns and have had an 'Aha!' (and not just a 'Huh?') experience with them, you won't ever think about object-oriented design in the same way."
- Quote from DPEOROOS

# Foreword

One of the ways that people use to measure the quality of an object-oriented system is to assess whether or not its developers have paid careful attention to the common 
collaborations among its objects.

Design patterns is a concepts also used in other disciplines like the building of cities, and its use in software allows developers to take advange of the expertise of 
other skilled architects.

For non-experienced object-oriented designers, the book recommends that they start with the simplest and most common patterns:

* Abstract Factory (page 87)
* Adapter (139)
* Composite (163)
* Decorator (175)
* Factory Method (107)
* Observer (293)
* Strategy (315)
* Template Method (325)
