# Introduction

The Rust programming language helps you write fastes, more reliable
software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at
odds in programming lanaguages design; Rust challenges that conflic.
Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer
experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details
(such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally
associated with such control.

## Who Rust Is For

Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons.

### Teams of Developers

Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large
teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming
knowledge. Low-level code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which
in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing
and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the
compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with
these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working alongside
the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program's
logic rather than chasing down bugs.

Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems
programming world:

* Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding,
  compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across
  the Rust ecosystem.
* Rustfmt ensures a consistent conding style across developers.
* The Rust Lanaguage Server powers Integrated Development Environment
  (IDE) integration for code completion and inlide error messages.

By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can
be productive while writing systems-level code.
