# Introduction

The Rust programming language helps you write fastes, more reliable
software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at
odds in programming lanaguages design; Rust challenges that conflic.
Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer
experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details
(such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally
associated with such control.

## Who Rust Is For

Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons.

### Teams of Developers

Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large
teams of developers with varying levels of systems programming
knowledge. Low-level code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which
in most other languages can be caught only through extensive testing
and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the
compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to compile code with
these elusive bugs, including concurrency.
