# Miscellaneous Information About Elixir

* Elixir is a dynamic programming language. But what is a "dynamic" language:

> In computer science, a dynamic programming language is a class of
> high-level programming languages, which at "runtime" execute many
> common programming behaviors that static programming languages
> perform during compilation. These behaviors could include an extension
> of the programming, by adding new code, by extending objects and 
> definitions, or by modifying the type system.

* Elixir is built on top of a rock-solid foundation: BEAM - Erlang's Virtual Machine.
* Functional concepts are centre to Elixir.
* Pattern matching is an elegant concept present in Elixir
* Recursion is well supported
* Data is immutable
* Instead of stateful programs you elegantly handle state in the same consistent way you handle concurrency and communication with external services: through the actor model and message passing.
* Phoenix is a full-featured web framework
* Elixir is well-suited for for many other use cases, even embedded software.
