## 20: Keep knowledge in plain text.

## 21: Use the power of Command Shells.

## 22: Use a single editor well.

Choose an editor, know it thoroughly, and use
it for all editing tasks.

Some editors use full-blown languages for 
customization and scripting. 
Emacs, for  example, uses Lisp. 
As one of the new languages you are going to 
learn this year,  learn the language your 
editor uses. 

For anything you find yourself 
doing  repeatedly, develop a set of macros 
(or equivalent) to handle it.
Do you know everything your editor is 
capable of doing? Try to stump your  
colleagues who use the same editor. 
Try to accomplish any given editing task in 
as  few keystrokes as possible.

## 23. Always use Source Code Control Systems

Always. Even if you are a single-person team on a one-week project. Even if it's a 
"throw-away" prototype. Even if the stuff you're working on isn't source code. Make sure 
that everything is under source code control—documentation, phone number lists, memos
to vendors, makefiles, build and release procedures, that little shell script that burns the CD
master—everything. We routinely use source code control on just about everything we
type (including the text of this book). Even if we're not working on a project, our day-to-day
work is secured in a repository.
