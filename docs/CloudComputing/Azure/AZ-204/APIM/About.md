# About API Management

API Management (APIM) is a way to create *consistent* and *modern* API gateways for existing back-end services.

API Managements helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. API Managements provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. You can use Azure API Management to take any backend and launch a full-fledged API program based on it.

## Overview

To use APIM, administrators create APIs. Each API consists of one or more operations, and each API can be added to one or more products. To use an API, developers subscribe to a product that contains that API, and then they can call the API's operation, subject to any usage policies that may be in effect. Common scenarios include:

* **Securing mobile infrastructure** by gating access with API keys, preventing DOS attacks by using throttling, or using advanced security policies like JWT token validation.
*  **Enabling ISV partner ecosystems** by offering fast partner onboarding through the developer portal and building and API facade to decouple from internal implementations that are not ripe for partner consumption.
*  **Running an internal API program** by offering a centralized location for the organization to communicate about the availability and latest changes to APIs, gating access based on organizational accounts, all based on a secured channel between the API gateway and the backend.
