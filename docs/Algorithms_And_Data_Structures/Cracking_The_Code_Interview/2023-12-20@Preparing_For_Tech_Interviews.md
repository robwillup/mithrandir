# Preparing For Tech Interviews

> Notes taken while reading the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jD8iswEACAAJ?hl=en)

## Get the right experience

* Use your time to actually build an application, contribute to an open-source project, hack a game, etc. It doesn't really matter what kind of app your doing, the relevant thing is that you're getting experience writing real code.
* At your work, as much as possible, try to get more coding tasks. You can automate some process with an app or script for example.
* Working on a software project on your free time, recruiters often like to find candidates who spend the free time coding just for fun, just because they like.

## Writing a great resume

Basically, your resume has to show two things:

* You're smart
* You can code

In the US, it is strongly advised to keep a resume to one page if you have less than ten years of experience.

Careful with long resumes. Shorter resumes are often more impressive.

## Employment History

Write about what you did, how, and the results. Make the results measurable. Example:

```docx
Created a mobile app using X that automated Y and saved Z annually.
```

## Projects

Create a projects section on your resume. This will show that you are a more experienced developer.

Again, it doesn't matter what you build, but making it open-source is often a good idea.

## Programming languages and software

It's probably irrelevant to add software like IDEs, DBMS, etc. Do not add office software.

For languages, one alternative is to add your experience level along with the language. For example:

* Languages: C# (expert), Go (proficient), JavaScript (prior experience)

But now after ChatGPT I honestly think that your experience with a particular programming language is also becoming less important. Honestly, Gen AI already is writing better software than we ever could. Other skills are becoming more relevant, such as ML and still foundational concepts in AI, computer science and other technology fields.

## You have to know that stigma exists

### Enterprise languages

VB or .NET as a whole: If not applying to these, you will need to show that you're really able to code in other languages. This even applies to C#.

### Being too language focused is not always good

Be careful to show that you're perfectly capable of using and mastering other languages, even though you've focused on another language so far.

### Certifications can have a negative impression

In some cases you will need to remove this from your resume because some companies will assume that you're too technology focused.

### Knowing only one or two languages

When a candidate only knows one or two languages companies tend to question: Why hasn't he learned other things?

Learn more languages. Build projects on different languages.
