# Notes On The Interview Process

> Notes taken while reading the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/jD8iswEACAAJ?hl=en)

At the largest tech companies, most of the interview process will be composed of algorithm and coding problems.
They want to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before.

As you are solving the problem, do your best to explain your thought process.

## What are the interviewers looking at?

* Analytical skills:
  * Did you need much help solving the problem? Did you get stuck too much?
  * How optimal was your solution? You need to know about time/space complexity.
  * How long did it take you to arrive at that solution?
  * Did you consider all trade-offs? Did you think of edge cases?
* Coding skills: reasonable, clean, organized, good style code
* Experience
* Culture fit / Communication skills

In a standard algorithm question, only the first three might matter.

## Why are coding interviews like that?

### False negatives are acceptable

From the company's perspective, it's acceptable to miss out on some good people. They are far more concerned with false positives: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

This means you have to be very good.

### Problem-solving skills are valuable

If you're able to work through several hard problems, you're probably very good at developing optimal algorithms. You're smart.

### Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful

Basic computer science knowledge is useful. Understanding trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and other knowledge does come up periodically. That knowledge is also a good "proxy", they are reasonably well-correlated with being a good developer.

### Whiteboards let you focus on what matters

Focus on solving the problem without worrying about environment.
