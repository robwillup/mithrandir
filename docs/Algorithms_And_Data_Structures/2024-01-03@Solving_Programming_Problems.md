### This is my difficulty as well:

    "I know coding syntax well but I can’t solve coding problems unless I review the solution. What is wrong with me?"

### Answer:

Most people trying to help others on this issue will give answers that don't seem to get what the problem is. Perhaps because the solution to it came intuitively to them or something like that. And for some reason most programming books ignore this altogether and mostly focus on syntax, despite what this question and difficulty to solve programming problems being at the heart of coding.

So here's how you resolve this issue. The magic word: `Decomposition`. Go google these: `procedural decomposition`, `stepwise refinement`, `top down design`. You'll quickly find superb examples on this. Basically it's about breaking down a problem into smaller problems and further breaking down those subproblems until they are at basic instruction level of programming — input, processing, storage, output…perhaps I can go further and say selection and repetition. I strongly suggest you get the book [Simple Program Design — Lee Anne Robertson](https://archive.org/details/simpleprogramdes0000robe_c3b2/mode/2up).

This is probably one of the, if not the biggest, reasons why programming is considered difficult. A lot of people who simply say, practice, don't understand how frustrating it is when you don't even have a clue where to go next in front of a blank editor.

Just thought I'd add new insight, having worked as a programming tutor recently, in addition to the above. Programming is really analysis. For the beginner (who is usually introduced first to procedural programming), I've noticed that from a problem statement verbs or actions phrases translate into the input, output, processing; adjectives into condition/comparison e.g “...when hot…”~ temperature >= someValue ; and adverbs usually indicate repetition. OOP and functional are all abstractions on procedural.
