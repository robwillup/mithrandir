# Elasticity and Scalability

Both Elasticity and Scalabitiy are related to handling the system's workload. The fundamental concept of the two is **adaptability**.
It refers to the system environment's ability to use as many resources as required. 

The difference between these two are:

1. Elasticity is:

> a tactical resource allocation operation. It provides the necessary resources required for the current task and handles varying loads
> for short periods. For example, running a sentiment analysis algorithm, doing database backups or just taking on user traffic surges
> on a website.

2. Scalability is:

> a strategic resource allocation operation. Scalability handles the increase and decrease of resources according to the system's workload
> demands.

These are their main benefits:

* Cost-effectiveness. Cloud scalability and cloud elasticity features constitute an effective resource management strategy
* Consistent performance
* Service availability.

## What is Cloud Elasticity?

Cloud elasticity i a system's ability to manage available resources according to the current workload requirements dynamically.

## What is Cloud Scalability?

Cloud scalability is the ability of the system's infrastructure to handle growing workload requirements while retaining a consistent performan adequately.
