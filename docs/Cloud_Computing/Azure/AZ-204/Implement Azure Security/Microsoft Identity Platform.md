# The Microsoft Identity Platform

>The Microsoft Identity Platform is an authentication service, open-source libraries, and application management tools.

## Authentication Service

Azure Active Directory

* Azure AD Connect = synchronizes On Premises identities into the cloud
* ADFS = federation mechanism based on open standards

## Open-Source Libraries

MSAL, etc.

* MSAL is OIDC compliant. It is a bunch of libraries for different stacks.
* Microsoft.Identity.Web
* Open ID Connect Compliant. This means that if there is not an implementation of MSAL for a language, like Ruby for example, developers can create a library for that.

## Application Management Tools

Threat protection

* Gallery and non gallery apps
* Single Tenant and Multi Tenant apps
* Authorization
* Consent
* Logs
