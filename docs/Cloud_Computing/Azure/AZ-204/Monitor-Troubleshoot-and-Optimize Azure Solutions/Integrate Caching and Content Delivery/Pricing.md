## How is my Content Delivery Network data transfers bill calculated?

Your Content Delivery Network outbound data transfers are aggregated each month during your billing cycle. For Standard and Premium outbound data transfers the first 10 TB are charged at the first price point, the next 40 TB at the second, and so on. For example, if you use 50 TB of Standard data transfers in Zone 1, 10 TB will be billed at $0.081 per GB, the next 40 TB will be billed at $0.075 per GB. For Acceleration outbound data transfers the same process is used with the first 50 TB being used for the first price point.
