# Hosting Function Apps

You can host Function Apps in:

* App Service Plan in Azure
* Locally for development (cross-platform)
* In a Docker container
  * [Official Microsoft Docker image for Azure Function Dotnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-dotnet)

## Advantages of using containers

* Host in an on-premises data center
* Host on other cloud provider

## Hosting Containers in Azure
* ACI
* AKS

## Limitations
* No automatic scaling
* Pay for as long as the container is running
