# Best Practices Studies

In this section we study and dive into software development and engineering best practices.

As defined in Wikipedia:

> Coding best practices are a set of informal rules that the software development community employ to help improve the quality of software. 

 ## Why are Coding Best Practices relevant?

 Computer programs often stay in use for a long time after they are created and released and so there must be practices that facilitate both development and maintenance of the app, that may be done by developers other than the original authors.
