# Best Practices Studies

Notes about software development and engineering best practices.

As defined in Wikipedia:

> Coding best practices are a set of informal rules that the software development community employ to help improve the quality of software.

(As people are saying that AI is much better than humans at programming, I wonder what will be the importance of best practices in the future. Will we ever get to a point where humans no longer need to write or review code? Will AI formalize these best practices?)

## Why are Coding Best Practices relevant?

Computer programs often stay in use for a long time after they are created and released and so there must be practices that facilitate both development and maintenance of the app, that may be done by developers other than the original authors.
