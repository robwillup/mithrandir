# SOLID

* Single Responsibility Principle
  * A class should have only one reason to change
* Open/Closed Principle
  * Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* Liskov's Substitution Principle
  * Derived classes must be substitutable for their based classes.
* Interface Segregation Principle
  * Avoid fat interfaces. Prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface.
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
