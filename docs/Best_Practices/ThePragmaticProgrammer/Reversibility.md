# Reversibility

Engineers prefer simple, single solution to problems. Unfortunately, while x is 2 today it may need to be 5 tomorrow, and 3 next week. If you rely heavily on some fact, you can almost guarantee that it will change.

There is always more than one way to implement something, and there is usually more than one vendor available to provide a third-party product. If you go into a project hampered by the myopic notion that there is only one way to so it, you maybe in for an unpleasant surprise. Many project teams have their eyes forcibly opened as the future unfolds.

The problem is that critical decisions aren't easily reversible.

## *Aim to produce flexible, adaptable software.*

Abstract the idea of database out of other code domains to the point where this abstraction simply provides persistence as a service.

The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stone - and in not preparing for the contingencies that might arise. Instead of carving decisions in stone, think of them more as being written in the sand at the beach. A big wave can come along and wipe them out at any time.
