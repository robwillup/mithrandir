## 20: Keep knowledge in plain text.

## 21: Use the power of Command Shells.

## 22: Use a single editor well.

Choose an editor, know it thoroughly, and use it for all editing tasks.

Some editors use full-blown languages for customization and scripting.
Emacs, for  example, uses Lisp. As one of the new languages you are going to learn this year, learn the language your
editor uses.

For anything you find yourself doing repeatedly, develop a set of macros (or equivalent) to handle it.
Do you know everything your editor is capable of doing? Try to stump your colleagues who use the same editor.
Try to accomplish any given editing task in as few keystrokes as possible.

## 23. Always use Source Code Control Systems

Always. Even if you are a single-person team on a one-week project. Even if it's a "throw-away" prototype. Even if the stuff you're working on isn't source code. Make sure that everything is under source code control—documentation, phone number lists, memos to vendors, makefiles, build and release procedures, that little shell script that burns the CD
master—everything. We routinely use source code control on just about everything we
type (including the text of this book). Even if we're not working on a project, our day-to-day
work is secured in a repository.
