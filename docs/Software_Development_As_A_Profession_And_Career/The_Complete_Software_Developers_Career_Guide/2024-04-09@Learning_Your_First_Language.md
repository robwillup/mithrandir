### Learning your first programming language

> Take an existing source code for a project written in the programming language you want to learn and start randomly going through files in the project.
> Open a file and go through each line of code in the file, making sure you understand exactly what it is doing.
> If you don't understand - and there will be plenty of things you wont't - take some time to think about it, and look up anything you don't understand.
> This is tedious. It might even be boring, but it's totally worth it.
> When you get to the point where you feel like you can read any line of code and understand what it is doing you are ready to move on.

This is super interesting because I was used to doing this to other things I was learning, like a new natural language, a different subject, etc., but frequently I would not apply this to programming. Repetition is tedious but it can perfect many practices.

> [When building new projects to practice] The idea is to build some simple applications that focus on utilizing the programming language you are learning and the standard libraries.
> Here are some simple project ideas to get you started:
>
> * Create a program that solves a mathematical problem by getting inputs from the user.
> * Create a Choose Your Own Adventure type of program where the input from the users determines what happens next.
> * Create a very simple text-based adventure game where the use can issue commands to pick up objects, move through rooms, etc.
> * Create a program that is able to read input from a text file and write output to a different file
> * Create a chatbot that talks to the user and pretends to be human or gives humorous responses

These are nice simple ideas for quick projects that can help you get used to a programming language.

> In order to create something useful with a programming language, you are going to need to apply it to a specific technology or platform.
> For example... if you decide to build an Android application with Java you will have to learn how to build Android application and about the Android framework. However, you'll already be familiar with Java, so you won't be trying to learn a huge amount of concepts at once without knowing what Java is or what Android is. You can, of course, learn Android and Java together, but to get a real mastery of the language and avoid confusion, isolating the language from the platform or technology and then combining them is probably going to be much easier (better).
>
> I'd also recommend that you specialize in just one technology or platform at this point. You can always learn more later. This will allow you to gain a deeper knowledge and competency in a particular technology, which will make you much more confident and greatly increase the marketability of your skills.
> With time, as you practice algorithm problems and look at how other people solve their problems, you start getting much better. You will begin to see patterns in how certain types of problems were solved. Here are some resources to practice these problems:
>
> * Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
> * Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley
> * Project Euler
> * Codility
> * Interview Cake
> * TopCoder
>
> These problems will be extremely difficult at first, and that is ok. They are supposed to be.
>
> Over time you will start to recognize that there are only a handful of types of problems, and you'll start to be able to identity how to solve them immediately.
> At first, you'll have no clue what to do, and like I said, that's ok - just keep trying.
> Also, don't forget to look at how other people have solved the problems you are struggling with. Try to understand why they solved particular problems the way they did.
> This was one of the best ways I was able to learn how to solve these kinds of problems. Once you can solve these types of programming problems with the programming language you are learning, you will not only be pretty close to mastery of the language, but also coding interviews will be a piece of cake for you while other candidates are seating through their shirts.
