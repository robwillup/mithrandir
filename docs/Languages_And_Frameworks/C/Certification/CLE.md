# CLE - C Certified Entry-Level Programmer Certification

[Official reference](https://cppinstitute.org/cle-c-certified-entry-level-programmer-certification)

The CLE certification is an interim step to the *CLA - C
Certified Associate Programmer* certification and the starting
point to launch a career in software development, low-level
and middle-level programming, C programming, and related
technologies. Becoming CLE certified will help you stand out
from other candidates and get your foot in the door.

CLE - C Certified Entry-Level Programmer certification shows
that the individual is familiar with universal computer
programming concepts like compilation, variables, data types,
typecasting, operators, conditional execution, loops, arrays,
pointers, memory management, functions, and the runtime
environment.

A test candidate should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of
the following concepts:

* the universal concepts of computer programming and developer tools;
* the fundamentals of the C language syntax and semantics;
* control and evaluations, data aggregates, functions, pointers, and memory management;
* writing and debugging simple programs using standard language infrastructure.
