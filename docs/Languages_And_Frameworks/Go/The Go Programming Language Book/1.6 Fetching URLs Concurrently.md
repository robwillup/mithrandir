# 1.6 Fetching URLs Concurrently

One of the most interesting and novel aspects of Go is its support for
concurrent programing.

The next program, `fetchall`, fetches many URLs, all concurrently,
so that the process will take no longer than the longest fetch rather
than the sum of all fetch times. This version of `fetchall` discards
the responses but reports the size and elapsed time for each one:

A *goroutine* is a concurrent function execution. A *channel*
is a communication mechanism that allows one goroutine to
pass values of a specified type to another goroutine.
The function main runs in a goroutine and the **go**
statement creates additional goroutines.
