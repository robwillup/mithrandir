## Overview

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build **simple**,
**reliable**, and **efficient** software.

As stated in the language's official website, one of Go's purposes is to make
developers more productive.

And to attain to that end, Go has an expressive, clean and concise syntax.
Also it has mechanisms that make it efficient, such as its concurrency that

Also Go has a type system that enables flexible and modular program construction.
