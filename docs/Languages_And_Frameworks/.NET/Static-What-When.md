# What is Static in C#

A static class cannot be instantiated.

## When to use Static classes and members

* When a field or method should be associated with the Class rather than with its instances, that field / method must be static.
* When a type should not be instantiated, but should rather just contain functions that will run on other data structures, then that type / class must be static.
