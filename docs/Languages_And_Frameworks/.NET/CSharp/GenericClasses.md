# Generic Classes

If a class has operations that are specific to some data type, it's not a generic class.
A data type can have operations that are only applicable to itself. For example, a `Lion` class may have a method called `Roar()`. That same method cannot be used by a `Horse` class.

Where dod you commonly see generic classes used? In collections. Like linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, trees, and so on.

Operations such as adding and removing items from the collection are performed in basically the same way regardless of the database being stored.
