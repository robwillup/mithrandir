## Introduction

The C# programming language allows you to build many types of applications, like:

* Business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
* Dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
* Games, both 2D and 3D
* Financial and scientific applications
* Cloud-based applications
* Mobile applications
* IoT applications

Applications are all made up of many lines of code that work together to achieve a task. By far, the best way to learn how to code is to
write code. It's encouraged that you write code along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path. Writing code
yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

You'll also begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual practice and exploration.

C# is a case-sensitive language, meaning that the C# compiler considers the words `console` and `Console` as different
as the words `cat` and `dog`. Sometimes, the error message can be a bit misleading. You'll need to understand the true reason why the error exists, and that comes through learning more about C#'s syntax.

To print an entire message to the output console, you used the first technique, `Console.WriteLine()`. At the end of the line, it added a line feed similar to how you create a new line of text by pressing Enter or Return.

To print to the output console, but without adding a line feed at the end, you used the second technique, `Console.Write()`. So the next call to `Console.Write()` prints another message to the same line.

### What is a programming language?

> Programming languages like C# let you write instructions that you want the computer to carry out.

Say you want your computer to ping another computer on the network to check it's connected. You can create your on application by writing instructions for the computer. To write these instructions in a way that you as a human can understand, you need to use a programming language such as C#. That language will later be translated into a type of language that the computer can understand.

> Each programming language has its own syntax, but they all share many similar concepts.

In Java if have ways to create execution branches with `if` statements, for example, and similar constructs are available in C#, C, Go, Python, etc.

> A programming language's job is to allow a human to express their intent in a human-readable way. The instructions you write in a programming language are called "source code" or just "code". Software developers write code. At this point a developer can update and change the code, but a computer can't understand the code. The code must be compiled into a format that the computer can understand.
