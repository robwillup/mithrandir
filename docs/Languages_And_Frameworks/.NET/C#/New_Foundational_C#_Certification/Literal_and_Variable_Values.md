## Introduction

Hard-coded values are values that are constant and unchanged throughout the execution of the program.

Suppose you want to display a formatted message to the end user containing different types of data. The message would include hard-codes strings combined with information your app collects from the user. To display a formatted message, you will need to created both hard-coded values and define variables that can store data of certain types, whether numeric, alphanumeric, and so on.

### Learning Objectives

* Create literal values for five basic data types
* Declare and initialize variables
* Retrieve and set values in variables
* Allow the compiler to determine the data type for your variable when initializing

* Single quotes create a character literal.
* Using double quotation marks creates a `string` data typs.
* The `int` is for integer numbers, not fractions.
* C# supports three data types to represent decimal numbers: `float`, `double`, and `decimal`. Each type supports varying degrees of precision.

|Float Type|Precision|
|:---------:|:-------:|
|float| ~6-9 digits|
|double|~15-17 digits|
|decimal| 28-29 digits|
