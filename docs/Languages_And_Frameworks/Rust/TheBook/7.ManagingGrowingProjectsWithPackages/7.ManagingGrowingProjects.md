# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

As programs get larger, organizing the source code becomes more important.

As a project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules and then multiple files.

A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into a separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated packages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces.

"Scopes" in Rust are similar to "Namespaces" in C# - avoid name collisions.

Rust's module system include:

* Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
* Crates: A tree of modules that produce a library or executable
* Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
* Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.
