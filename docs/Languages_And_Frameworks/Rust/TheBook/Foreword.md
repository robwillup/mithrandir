# Foreword

Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider
variety of domains than you did before. Programmers who need to "dip down"
into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on the
customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn
the fine points of a fickle toolchain. The language is designed to guide
you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed
and memory usage.

Rust is not limited to low-level systems programming. It's expressive and
ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of
code quite pleasant to write.
