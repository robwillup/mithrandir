# About the Elixir Language

One of the purposes of Elixir is to revamp and enhance developers' experience with Erlang systems. It has features from Erlang, Clojure, and Ruby. 

Elixir ships with a toolset that simplifies project management, testing, packaging, and documentation building.

Having the Erlang runtime as the target platform means Elixir-based systems are able to use all the libraries from the Erlang ecosystem, including the battle-tested OTP framework that ships with Erlang.
