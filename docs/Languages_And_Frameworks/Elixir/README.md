# Elixir

[Reference](https://elixir-lang.org/)

>Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

>Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development, embedded software, data integration, and multimedia processing domains.

## Why learn Elixir?

I have decided to dedicate time to learn Elixir for the following reasons:

1. The Pragmatic Programmer book: This is an awesome book and one of the tips in there is to learn a new programming language every year, because this forces your brain to think differently about how to solve problems.
2. Functional Programming: The concepts of Functional Programming have completely blown my mind. Things like immutable variables, pattern matching, pure functions, just seem to make obvious sense.
3. Dynamic language: I have experience with static languages such as C# and Go, and I wanted to learn a dynamic language as an exercise.
