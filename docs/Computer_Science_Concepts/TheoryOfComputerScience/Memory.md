## What is a *Data Buffer* ?

In computer science, a **data buffer** (or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data while it is being moved from one place to another. Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrived from an input device (such as a microphone) or just before it is send to an output device (such as speakers). However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer. This is comparable to buffers in telecommunication.
