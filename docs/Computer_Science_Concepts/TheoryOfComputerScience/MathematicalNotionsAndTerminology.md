# Automata Theory

Automata theory deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation. These models play a role in several applied areas of computer science. One model, called the *finite automaton*, is used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design. Another model, called the *context-free grammar*, is used in programming languages and artificial intelligence.

Automata theory is an excellent place to begin the study of the theory of computation. The theories of computability and complexity require a precise definition of a *computer*. Automata theory allows practice with formal definitions of computation as it introduces concepts relevant to other nontheoretical areas of computer science.

# Mathematical Notions and Terminology

As in any mathematical subject, we begin with a discussion of the basic mathematical objects, tools, and notations that we expect to use.

## SETS
A **set** is a group of objects represented as a unit. Sets may contain any type of object, including numbers, symbols, and even other sets. The objects in a set are called its **elements** or **members**. Sets may be described formally in several ways.
One way is by listing a set's elements inside braces. Thus the set

            S = {7,21,57}

contains the elements 7, 21, and 57. The symbols ∈ and ∉ denote set membership and nonmembership. We write 7 ∈ {7,21,57} and 8 ∉ {7,21,57}. For two sets A and B, we say that A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if every member of A is also a member of B. We say that A is a proper subset of B, written A ⊈ B, if A is a subset of B and not equal to B.

The order of describing a set doesn't matter, nor does repetition of its members. We get the same set S by writing {57,7,7,7,21}
