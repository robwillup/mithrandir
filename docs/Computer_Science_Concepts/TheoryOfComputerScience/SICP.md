# Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs

*"To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs - many of them"*

*"the uncovering and mastery of powerful organizational techniques accelerates our ability to create large, significant programs. Conversely, since writing large programs is very taxing, we are stimulated to invent new methods of reducing the mass of function and detail to be fitted into large programs"*

*"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for computers to execute."*

The SICP book addresses the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.

Students who complete this subject should have a good feel for the elements of style and aesthetics of programming.

*"We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventional interfaces that enables us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a "mix and match" way"*

*"Well-designed computational systems... are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately."*

## The Elements of Programming

In programming we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data.
