# Foreword Notes

"To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right"
you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs
-- many of them."

You must learn to appreciate how well these programs perform
and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation
of still greater programs. That's what matters.

"The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection".

"Every computer program is a model...of a real or mental process".

"...out programs...continually evolve"

"The source of exhilaration associated with computer programming
is the continual unfolding within the mind and on the computer
of mechanisms expressed as programs and the explosion of perception they generate."

"Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial that
we develop an arsenal of standard program structures of whose
correctness we have become sure -- we call them idioms -- and
learn to combine them into larger structures using organizational techniques
of proven value."

It is essential to anyone wanting to join the enterprise
of programmers that they understand the organizational techniques.

"A programmer should acquire good algorithms and idioms.
Even though some programs resist precise specifications,
it is the responsibility of the programmer to estimate,
and always attempt to improve, their performance."

Fortran was used for scientific and engineering computation and
Lisp was used for artificial intelligence.
