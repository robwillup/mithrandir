# Preface to the First Edition - Notes

"The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" is the entry-vel subject
in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Two major concerns addressed by this book:

1. Establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of
getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is
a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology.
Thus, programs must be written for people to read,
and only incidentally for machines to execute.

2. The essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level
is not the syntax of a particular programming-language constructs,
nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions
efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms
and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques
used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.
