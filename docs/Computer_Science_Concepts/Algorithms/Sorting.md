# Sorting

There are 6 ways to sort:

* selection sort - naive
* insertion sort - naive
* bubble sort - naive
* merge sort - optimal
* heap sort - optimal
* quick sort - optimal

The three first sorts are considered naive because they are
the most intuitive. However they are considered useless or
inefficient because for every item we need to sort, those algorithms
will have to consider all the other items.
