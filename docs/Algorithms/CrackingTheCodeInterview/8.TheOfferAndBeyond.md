# The Offer and Beyond

This chapter has tips about handling offers, rejections, etc.

## Negotiation

Do yourself a favor. Negotiate.

* Have a specific ask. It's more effective to ask for an additional $7000 in salary than to ask for "more".
* Think beyond salary. Other benefits might be interesting as well.

## On the Job

Once you actually join a company you need to keep thinking about your career path. Where will you go from
here, and how will you get there?

### Set a Timeline

When you're enjoying your job, it's very easy to get wrapped up in it and not realize that your career is
not advancing. This is why you should outline your career path before starting a new job. Where do you
want to be in 10 years? What are the steps to get there? And then every year review this goals and what
short term goals will help you advance in the objective.

### Build Strong Relationships

Network is critical. Be open to helping others.

### Keep Interviewing

Set a goal of interviewing at least once a year, even if you aren't actively looking for a new job. This
will keep your interview sills fresh, and also keep you in tune with what sorts of opportunities and
salaries are out there.

If you get an offer, you don't have to take it. It will still build a connection with that company in
case you want to join at a later date.
