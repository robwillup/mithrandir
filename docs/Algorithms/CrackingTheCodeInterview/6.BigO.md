# Big O

This is such an important concept that you should master it!

Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. Not understanding it thoroughly can really hurt you in developing an algorithm. You will be judged harshly for not really understanding Big O, but you will also struggle to judge when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.
