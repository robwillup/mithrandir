# Technical Questions

If you just read through problems and solutions, you won't learn anything because that is similar to trying to learn calculus by reading a problem and its solutions. You need to practice solving problems. Memorizing solutions won't help much.

For each problem you might encounter, do the following:

1. Try to solve the problem on your own.
   1. Push yourself to develop a solutions with as little help as possible.
   2. Make sure to think about space and time efficiency.
2. Write the code on paper.
   1. Coding on a computer offers luxuries such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and quick debugging. Coding on paper does not.
   2. Get used to this and to how slow it is to write and edit code by coding on paper.
3. Test your code - on paper.
   1. This means testing the general cases, base cases, error cases, worst cases, edge cases, and so on.
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer.
   1. You will probably make a bunch of mistakes. Start a lis of all the errors so that you can focus on learning to correct them.

## What you need to know

This a a baseline of knowledge you need to have.

### Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts

Here is a list of the absolute, must-have knowledge:

* Data Structures
  * Linked Lists
  * Trees, Tries, & Graphs
  * Stacks & Queues
  * Heaps
  * Vectors / ArrayLists
  * Hash Tables
* Algorithms
  * Breadth-First Search
  * Depth-First Search
  * Binary Search
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
* Concepts
  * Bit Manipulation
  * Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
  * Recursion
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Big O Time & Space

For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable, the time and space complexity.

Practicing implementing the data structures and algorithm on paper, and then on a computer, is also a great exercise. It will help you understand the internals of the data structures work.

In particular, hash tables are an extremely important topic. Make sure you are very comfortable with this data structure.
