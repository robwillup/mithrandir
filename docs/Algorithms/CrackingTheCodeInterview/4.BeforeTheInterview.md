# Before the Interview

## Get the right experience

* Start Something: Build a project on your own time, participate in hackathons, or contribute to an open source project. It doesn't matter too much what it is. The important thing is that you're coding.
* Shift Work Responsibilities more towards coding.
* Use your nights and weekends. If you have some free time, use it to build a mobile app, a web app, or a piece of desktop software. Doing such projects is also a great way to get experience with new technologies, making you more relevant to today's companies. This project work should definitely be listed on your resume; few things are as impressive to an interviewer as a candidate who built something "just for fun".

## Writing a great resume

My resume must show that I am smart and that I can code.

In the US, it is strongly advised to keep a resume to one page if you have less than ten years of experience.

Think twice about a long resume. Shorter resumes are often more impressive.
