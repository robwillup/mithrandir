# Introduction to Algorithm Design

What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.

An algorithm must solve a general, well-specified problem. An algorithmic problem is specified by describing the complete set of instances it must work on and of its output after running on one of these instances.

> So to have an algorithm, I must know what is the general problem it's trying to solve. For example, searching, ordering, etc. And instances of that problem, e.g.: ordering a string, searching of an integers in an unordered list, etc.
