# Designing Your Web Application in Rust

To build a standalone script, you can create a file with the extension `.rs`, type in your
Rust code in it and compile it with `rustc`. For example:

Create a file:

```bash
vim hello_rob.rs
```

Type in some Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, Rob!");
}
```

Compile it:

```bash
rustc hello_rob.rs
```

Run it:

```bash
$ ./hello_rob

Hello, Rob!
```

This approach is not recommended for managing programs spanning multiple files. It is not even
recommended when relying on dependencies. This is where Cargo comes in. Cargo manages everything -
the running, testing, documentation, building, and dependency - out of the box with a few simple
commands.

## Building with Cargo

Navigate to a directory where you want to build your project and run:

```bash
cargo new web_app
```

This builds a basic structure for our app with the following directory:

```bash
____web_app/
    |__ Cargo.toml
    |__ src/
		|__ main.rs
```

The `src` directory is where we will house our code for the program. The point
for the program is in the `main.rs` file. In development, we want to run
`Cargo.toml` file is where metadata around the program is defined, and the entry
the program multiple times with incremental changes:

```bash
cargo run
```

This compiles code in an unoptimized manner with debug information in the newly
created `./target/debug` directory under the binary `web_app`. Once the
compilation process has been completed, it runs in the console directly. If we
want to build a release, we simply run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This compiles an optimized version of our app in the `./target/release/`
directory under the binary `web_app`.

## Shipping crates with Cargo

Third-party libraries are referred to as crates. Let's explore the `rand` crate,
available at [https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand/index.html]. To use this
crate in our project, we open the `Cargo.toml` file and add `rand` crate under
the `[dependencies]` section.

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.7.3"
```

Now we can use it:

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;

fn generate_float(generator: &mut ThreadRng) -> f64 {
	let placeholder: f64 = generator.gen();
	return placeholder * 10.0
}

fn main() {
	let mut rng: ThreadRng = rand::thread_rng();

	let random_number = generate_float(&mut rng);
	println!("{}", random_number);
}
```

## Documenting with Cargo

We can define markdown language within the Rust file with the following:

```rust
/// This function generates a float number using a number
/// generator passed into the function.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * generator (&mut ThreadRng): the random number
/// generator to generate the random number.
///
/// # Returns
/// (f64): random number between 0 -> 10
fn generate_float(generator: &mut ThreadRng) -> f64 {
	let placeholder: f64 = generator.gen();
	return placeholder * 10.0
}
```

## Interacting with Cargo

In order to enable our program to have some flexibility depending on the
context, we need to be able to pass parameters into our program and also keep
track of the parameters in which the program is running. We do this using the
`std` (standard library) keyword:

```rust
use std::env;
let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
println!("{:?}", args);
```

What happens here is that we collect the arguments from the environment and
print them utilizing the debug operator.

```rust
let path: &str = &args[0];

if path.contains("/debug/") {
	println!("The development app is running");
}
else if path.contains("/release/") {
	println!("The production app is running");
}
else {
	panic!("The setting is neither debug or release");
}
```

## Structuring Code

Structuring code is an important part of developing any web app. Because of
this, we have to get comfortable breaking down a problem into components that
Rust can manage and execute. Let's learn how to build well-structured code that
is scalable.
