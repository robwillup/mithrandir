# Designing Your Web Application in Rust

To build a standalone script, you can create a file with the extension `.rs`, type in your
Rust code in it and compile it with `rustc`. For example:

Create a file:

```bash
vim hello_rob.rs
```

Type in some Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, Rob!");
}
```

Compile it:

```bash
rustc hello_rob.rs
```

Run it:

```bash
$ ./hello_rob

Hello, Rob!
```

This approach is not recommended for managing programs spanning multiple files. It is not even
recommended when relying on dependencies. This is where Cargo comes in. Cargo manages everything -
the running, testing, documentation, building, and dependency - out of the box with a few simple
commands.
