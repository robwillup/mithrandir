## Hardware Based Encryption

This type of encryption uses computer hardware for assisting or replacing the software when data encryption is taking place.

These hardware devices are capable of storing encryption keys and sensitive information in secured areas of RAM or other nonvolatile storage devices.

### Hardware Encryption Devices

**Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**

This is a cryptoprocessor chip that is present on the motherboard and securely stores the encryption key and performs many cryptographic operations. It provides authentication and platform integrity, full disk encryption capabilities, software license protection.

**Hardware Security Module (HSM)**

This is an additional external security device that is used in a system for crypto-processing and it can be used for managing, generating and securely storing keys. It offers enhanced encryption computation. Some HSM devices include SafeNet Luna Network HSM, Cloud HSM, and Cryptosec Dekaton.

**USB Encryption**

An additional feature for USB devices, it offers onboarding crypto services, USB encryption provides protection against malware and helps in preventing data loss and data leakage. Some hardware USB-encrypted devices include Crypto USB, Kingston Ironkey D300S, and diskAshur Pro 500GB.

**Hard Drive Encryption**

This is a technology where the data stored in the hardware can be encrypted using a wide variety of encryption options. These require TPM or an HSM. This is used in Military-grade AES and DiskCypher AES SATA.
