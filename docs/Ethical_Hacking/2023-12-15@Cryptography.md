<h2>Cryptography For Beginners</h2>

In my first years as a software developers, I heard and read this word a lot: `cryptography`.
I even used it in parts of my work. But at that time my understanding of it was still very superficial and unstructured.
In this very short post I attempt to offer a simple explanation of cryptography for others who may also feel like they need to understand it better.

### What does word cryptography mean?

Words cary a world of meaning and history and getting to know how they have been formed and what each part means can be incredibly helpful and goes a long way in structuring our understanding of things. Let's take a look at the etymology and morphology of the word `cryptography`.

According to [etymonline.com](https://www.etymonline.com/word/cryptography), cryptography is the *art of writing in secret characters* and it's formed with the Greek works *kryptos* which means "hidden" and *graphia* "to write".

This is simple but true about cryptography, it's a technique to hide text or data.

### What is the purpose of cryptography?

To put it simply: protect data.

The purpose is to help with the notion that a message or other piece of data should only be available to the intended recipient.
Cryptography provides confidentiality. When done properly, it will make it harder for others to spy on data that they should not have access to.

Another way that cryptography helps protect data is through authentication. Since only the intended party can access that data, it's possible to determine the identity of whoever legitimately access that data.

And a third aspect of this data protection is something they call *non-repudiation*. This means that cryptography provides a way to prevent someone from denying that they have interacted with a piece of data when they in fact did.
