# Site Reliability Engineering

SRE can be described as the collision of the traditional IT role and DevOps.

Software Reliability Engineers should spend half of their time solving customer issues, escalations, responding to incidents.
And the other half is to be actively trying to automate everything.

Automation is core. It is to approach operations with a developer mindset.

A site reliability engineer is the source of knowledge for your group. SRE crosses all boundaries, hardware, software, monitoring, logging, automation.

SRE excels at programmatically identifying where failures could happen ahead of the time.

RCA: Root cause analysis.

The originator of the term "Site Reliability Engineer" is Ben Treynor, VP of Engineering at Google. And this is his own definition:

"SRE is what happens when you treat operations as a software problem and staff it with a bunch of software engineers."

* SRE teams are made up of software engineers
* who build and implement software
* to improve the reliability of their systems/services

What is a "system" in this context?

Servers, cloud and virtualization, applications and services, databases, networks

What does "Reliability" mean?

In this context, a service or system is reliable if they are rarely down or unavailable.

SRE tries to automate the process of evaluating the effects the changes will have.

That automated evaluation is done through SLA.

* Service Level Agreement
  * commitment between service provider and customer.

SRE vs DevOps

SRE has more focus on reliability, while DevOps has more focus on delivery speed.
