# Windows (Windows and Messages)

[Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/windows)

In a graphical Windows-based application, a window is a rectangular area of the
screen where the application displays output and receives input from the user.
Therefore, one of the first tasks of a graphical Windows-based application is to
create a window.

A window shares the screen with other windows, including those from other
applications. Only one window at a time can receive input from the user. The user
can use the mouse, keyboard, or other device to interact with this window and the
application that owns it.
