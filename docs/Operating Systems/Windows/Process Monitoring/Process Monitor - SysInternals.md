Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time
file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of
two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive
list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive
event properties such as sission IDs and user names, reliable process information,
full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for operation, simultaneous
loging to a file, and much more.
Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your
system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.
