# Git Concepts

## Why use Git?

Git is commonly used for version control. A commit in Git is a version of the files
in the repository. Different commits are different versions of the same files/repo.
They can be thought of as backups, copies.
A remote Git provider is like a remote backup of the repo.

## Using Git

Git gives us two extra containers. These live inside a folder in our local file
system. These two extra containers are called the `staging area` and the `repository`.
