## Neural Networks Architecture

> A single neuron is not enough for executing tasks related to pattern recognition or classification
> Several neurons must be connected
> The architecture is necessary for organizing these neurons

### Single Layer Artificial Neural Network

> It has the trait that it's a network that's feedforwarded because information always flows in a single direction, from input to output.
> It can be used for simple problems

### Multiple Layer Artificial Neural Networks

> For complex problems
> It has a hidden layer of neurons

### Recurring Networks

> These are different from feedforwared ANN because they have at least one loop for feedback

### Totally connected networks

### Partially connected networks

## Learning Paradigms

* Supervised Learning
 * The teacher tells the system what is the desired output
 * The real output is compared to the desired output
 * If they differ, an error signal is send back to the system
* Reinforcement Learning
 * The learning by reinforcement is a learning problem that's based on behavior
 * It happens through the interaction of the system with its environment, seeking to achieve a goal, despide the unknowns

## Learning rules

* Learning by error correction
* Learning by memory
* Hebbian learning
* Competitive learning
* Boltzmann Learning

## Learning Tasks

* Classification
* Pattern association
* Pattern recognition
* Control other systems
* Filtering
