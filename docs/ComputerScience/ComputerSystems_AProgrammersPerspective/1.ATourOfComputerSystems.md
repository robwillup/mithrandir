# A Tour of Computer Systems

A computer systems consists of hardware and systems software that work together to run
application programs. Specific implementations of systems change over time, but the
underlying concepts do not.

You need to dedicate yourself to learn the concepts in this book.

This is the ASCII text representation of hello.c:

```text

## 1.1 Information Is Bits + Context

The hello program begins life as a source program (or source file) that the programmer
creates with an editor and saves in a text file called `hello.c`. The source program
is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called
bytes. Each byte represents some text character in the program.
