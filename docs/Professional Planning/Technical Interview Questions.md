# Technical Interview Questions

These are some of the questions that I was asked on technical interviews from
different companies:

**With a document database, like MongoDB for example, when having to insert a
large amount of data, is it better to insert all at once or split the data
into chunks and do it one at a time?**

The correct answer was to split the data because if we try to insert all at
once, that may exceed the throughput limitation and we would get an error.

**When saving hashed passwords to a database, how is the SALT stored?**

**Design Patterns?**
