## 1.1 What is a Design Pattern?

"The description of a problem that occurs frequently as well as the description of the core of the solution which can be reused."

Elements of a pattern:

1. Pattern name: Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us talk about them with our colleagues, in our documentation, and even to ourselves.
2. Problem: When to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its context. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions that must be met before it makes sense to apply the problem.
3. Solution: the pattern provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it.
4. Consequences: the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.


In this book a design pattern a *description of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context*.

Each design pattern focuses on a particular object-oriented design problem or issue.
