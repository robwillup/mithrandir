# Let us count!

## 2.2 Sets and the like

We want to formalize assertions like "the problem of counting
the number of hands in the bridge is essentially the same as
the problem of counting tickets in the lottery". The usual
tool in mathematics to do this is the notion of *set*.
Any collection of things, called elements, is a set. The deck
of cards is a set, whose elements are the cards. The participants
of the party form a set, whose elements are the participants.

For mathematics, various sets of numbers are important: the
set of real numbers, denoted by R; the set of rational numbers,
denoted by Q; the set of integers, denoted by Z; the set of
non-negative integers, denoted by Z+; the set of positive integers, denoted by N.
The empty set, the set with no element is another important set;
it is denoted by Ø.

If A is set and b is an element of A, we write b ∈ A.
The number of elements of a set A (also called cardinality of A) is denoted by |A|.
Thus |P| = 7; |Ø| = 0; and |Z| = ∞ (infinity).

We may specify a set by listing its elements between braces; so

P = {Alice, Bob, Carl, Diane, Eve, Frank, George}

is the set of participants of Alice's birthday party, or

{12,23,27,33,67}

is the set of numbers on my uncle's lottery ticket.
Sometimes we replace the list by a verbal description, like

{Alice and her guests}

Often we specify a set by a property that singles out the
elements from a large universe like real numbers. We then
write this property inside the braces, but after a colon.
Thus

{x ∈ Z : x ≥ 0}

is the et of non-negative integers (which we have called Z+ before), and

{x ∈ P : x is a girl} = {Alice, Diane, Eve}

A set A is called a *subset* of a set B, if every element of
A is also an element of B. In other words, A consists of certain
elements of B. If A consists of every element of B than A = B,
or none of them, in which case A = Ø.
So the empty set is a subset of every set.
The relation that A is a subset of B is denoted by

A ⊆ B.

Among the sets of numbers, wew have a long chain:

∅ ⊆ N ⊆ Z+ ⊆ Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R

The *intersection* of two sets is the set consisting of those
elements that are elements of both sets. The intersection of
two sets A and B is denoted by A ∩ B. For example, we have
G ∩ D = {Alice}. Two sets whose intersection is the empty
set (in other words, have no element in common) are called
*disjoint*.
