# Discrete Mathematics - Introduction

Calculus is the single most important field of mathematics.
Its emergence in the 17th century signalled the birth of
modern mathematics and was the key to the successful
applications of mathematics in the sciences.

But calculus (or analysis) is also very technical.
To get a feeling for the power of its methods, say be
describing one of its important applications in detail,
takes years of study.

If you want to become a mathematician, computer science, or
engineer, this investment is necessary.

Other importatn areas in applied mathematics include linear
programming, coding theory, theory of computing. The mathematics
in these applications is collectively called *discrete mathematics*.
("Discrete" here is used as the opposite of "continuous"; it
is also often used in the more restrictive sense of "finite".)

Another important ingredient of mathematics is *problem solving*.
You won't be able to learn any mathematics without dirtying
your hands and trying out the ideas you learn about in the
solution of problems.
