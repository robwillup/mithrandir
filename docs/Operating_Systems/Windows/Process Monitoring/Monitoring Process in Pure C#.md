# Monitoring Process with C# Managed Code Only

Monitoring process activity related to file and directory enumeration purely
using managed code (C#) without any reliance on native Windows APIs is not
feasible.

The low-level monitoring of process behavior, such as file and directory
enumeration, typically requires interacting with operating system functions and
APIs that are not directly exposed in managed code. These functions reside in
the Windows kernel and are typically accessed through native APIs using
techniques like P/Invoke or interop.

While C# and managed code provide a convenient and safe programming environment,
they have limitations when it comes to accessing low-level system functionality.
To monitor which processes on Windows are enumerating files and directories, you
would need to combine managed code with native APIs or utilize external
libraries or tools that provide the necessary system-level access.

In summary, for this specific task, you would need to incorporate native Windows
APIs or use a combination of managed and native code to achieve the desired
process monitoring functionality.
