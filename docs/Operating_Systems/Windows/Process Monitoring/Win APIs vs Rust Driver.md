# Windows APIs vs Rust Driver

The choice between using Windows APIs through P/Invoke or writing a driver in
Rust depends on several factors, including the level of access and control you
require, the complexity of the monitoring task, and your familiarity with the
technologies involved. Here are some considerations:

Windows APIs through P/Invoke:

If you only need to monitor file and directory enumeration and don't require
deep system-level access, using Windows APIs through P/Invoke can be a suitable
approach.
P/Invoke allows you to call native Windows functions from managed code,
including APIs related to file system monitoring.
This approach is generally easier to implement and may be sufficient for most
monitoring scenarios.
It does not require writing kernel-level code or dealing with the complexities
of driver development.
However, it is important to carefully research and select the appropriate
Windows APIs to ensure you have access to the necessary functionality.
Writing a driver in Rust:

If you require extensive control and deep system-level access, developing a
kernel driver in a language like Rust can be a viable option.
Writing a driver allows for direct interaction with the Windows kernel and
provides fine-grained monitoring capabilities.
It requires advanced knowledge of operating system internals, driver development
concepts, and the Rust programming language.
Developing a driver involves a more complex development process, including
building, signing, and installing the driver.
Additionally, driver development requires careful consideration of stability,
security, and potential system impacts.
In summary, if your monitoring requirements can be fulfilled using Windows APIs
through P/Invoke, it is generally a simpler and more accessible approach.
However, if you need extensive system-level control and advanced monitoring
capabilities, writing a driver in Rust might be a more suitable choice. Consider
your specific needs, resources, and expertise before making a decision.
